I'll help you create a GitHub Copilot client plugin that connects to your Spring AI-based MCP server for fetching BitBucket repositories as resources. This will be a comprehensive implementation following GitHub Copilot's extension standards.Now let me create the accompanying package.json and extension configuration files:I've created a comprehensive GitHub Copilot client plugin that connects to your Spring AI-based MCP server for BitBucket integration. Here's what the implementation includes:

## Key Features:

1. **MCP Client Implementation**: Full MCP protocol support with JSON-RPC 2.0 communication
2. **BitBucket Integration**: Methods to search code, fetch file content, and get repository structure
3. **GitHub Copilot Chat Participant**: Native integration with Copilot's chat interface using the `@bitbucket-mcp` participant
4. **VS Code Extension**: Complete extension structure with proper activation and configuration

## Architecture Components:

### 1. **MCPClient Class**
- Handles MCP protocol communication with your Spring AI server
- Supports resource listing, reading, and BitBucket-specific operations
- Includes proper error handling and authentication

### 2. **BitBucketCodeProvider Class**
- Provides intelligent code context from your repository
- Searches for relevant files based on user queries
- Manages repository structure analysis

### 3. **CopilotMCPChatParticipant Class**
- Integrates with GitHub Copilot's chat system
- Processes user requests and provides repository context
- Streams responses with progress indicators

## Expected MCP Server Endpoints:

Your Spring AI MCP server should implement these methods:
- `initialize` - MCP handshake
- `resources/list` - List available repository resources
- `resources/read` - Read specific file content
- `bitbucket/search` - Search code in repository
- `bitbucket/file` - Get specific file content

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Install dependencies**: The package.json includes all necessary dependencies
2. **Configure settings**: Set your MCP server URL and BitBucket credentials in VS Code settings
3. **Build and package**: Use `npm run compile` and `npm run package` to create the extension
4. **Install**: Install the generated .vsix file in VS Code

## Usage:

Once installed, users can interact with your BitBucket repository through GitHub Copilot chat:
- `@bitbucket-mcp Show me the repository structure`
- `@bitbucket-mcp Find code similar to what I'm working on`
- `@bitbucket-mcp Help me implement this feature based on existing patterns`

The plugin automatically provides repository context to enhance Copilot's responses, making code suggestions more relevant to your specific codebase.

Would you like me to modify any specific aspects of the implementation or add additional features?
