I'll create an architecture diagram showing how your GitHub Copilot MCP client plugin integrates with the Spring AI MCP server and BitBucket.I've created a comprehensive architecture diagram that shows the complete flow of your GitHub Copilot MCP BitBucket integration. Here's how the system works:

## **Architecture Overview:**

### **1. VS Code Environment (Blue)**
- **GitHub Copilot Extension**: Handles the chat interface and language model interactions
- **MCP Client Plugin**: Your custom plugin with three main components:
  - `CopilotMCPChatParticipant`: Manages chat requests and responses
  - `BitBucketCodeProvider`: Provides repository-specific code context
  - `MCPClient`: Handles MCP protocol communication
- **VS Code Core**: Active editor, configuration, and UI components

### **2. Network Layer (Pink)**
- **HTTP/JSON-RPC 2.0**: The communication protocol between the plugin and your Spring AI server

### **3. Spring AI MCP Server (Green)**
- **MCP Protocol Layer**: Handles MCP standard operations (initialize, resources, search)
- **Spring AI Components**: AI services, embeddings, and vector storage for intelligent code analysis
- **BitBucket Integration**: API client and services for repository access

### **4. BitBucket Cloud (Orange)**
- External BitBucket workspace, repositories, source files, and metadata

## **Data Flow:**

1. **User Input**: User types a query with `@bitbucket-mcp` in Copilot chat
2. **Context Gathering**: Plugin fetches relevant code from BitBucket via MCP server
3. **AI Enhancement**: Spring AI server uses embeddings and vector search to find relevant code
4. **Response Generation**: Enhanced context is sent to GitHub Copilot's language model
5. **User Response**: Copilot provides contextually-aware code suggestions

## **Key Integration Points:**

- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized communication between the plugin and server
- **Vector Search**: AI-powered code similarity and relevance matching
- **Repository Context**: Real-time access to your BitBucket codebase
- **Copilot Integration**: Native chat participant in GitHub Copilot interface

This architecture ensures that your GitHub Copilot experience is enhanced with intelligent, context-aware suggestions based on your actual BitBucket repository code, making it much more relevant and useful for your specific development workflows.
